Hi there! ![ ](images/wave.gif)

I am a passionate second-year student, studying Computer Science at Constructor University Bremen, Germany. I enjoy tackling complex problems and finding innovative solutions, particularly in areas such as robotics and software development. 
While I am still exploring my interests and opportunities that computer science brings you, I am particularly drawn towards roles where I can combine my software engineering skills with robotics to create intelligent, functional systems. Artificial Intelligence and machine learning also fascinate me, and Iâ€™m eager to learn more about  them and explore all the possible opportunities that they offer. 
I am currently looking to apply my skills in real-world projects, learn from others and dive into roles that push me to grow.
