I'm a second-year Computer Science student at Constructor University Bremen, Germany. I have a passion for tackling complex challenges and crafting innovative solutions, particularly in **software development** and **robotics**.

While I’m still exploring the wide range of opportunities that computer science offers, I'm especially drawn to roles where I can blend my **software engineering skills with robotics** to build intelligent, functional systems. I’m also fascinated by **Artificial Intelligence and machine learning** and am eager to dive deeper into these fields to unlock their potential.

Currently, I’m seeking real-world projects where I can apply my skills, learn from others, and take on challenges that push me to grow.
